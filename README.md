# pii_detection

### This repository contains much of the PII detection created for the BLOOM LLM.

##### The 'NER examples' folder contains PII detection techniques and pre-existing models/libraries that were used either in early process (screen corpus' of information for use in the smaller LLM's), or for benchmarking.
