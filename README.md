# pii_detection

#### This repository contains much of the PII detection created for the BLOOM LLM.

##### The 'NER examples' folder contains PII detection techniques and pre-existing models/libraries that were used either in early process (screen corpus' of information for use in the smaller LLM's), or for benchmarking. 

##### The 'regex spacy hybrid v2' Jupyter Notebook file has a basic combination of PII detection tools for better overall performance, in addition to being able to specifically target certain types of PII.
